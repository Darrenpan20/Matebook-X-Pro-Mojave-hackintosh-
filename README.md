Good Luck, have fun, and happy Thanksgiving. 

There are 2 clover folders. One is for the USB, and the other is after you install Mojave. Rename the latter to CLOVER when you paste it in the EFI partition. 
EFI mounter is to Mount the EFI.
Kext Utility is used to install kexts to system/library/extension. While most of the kexts should be in the EFI parition /EFI/CLOVER/KEXTS/OTHERS, the AppleCFLgraphics kext needs to be installed to SLE. 

###Also, if you really want to, you can help me out with a small donation..Thanks!
